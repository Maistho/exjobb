\begin{abstract}
Planning poker is a technique for estimating the time required for tasks
within a programming project, which tries to eliminate certain biases of
the participants in order to achieve greater accuracy of the estimates\cite{grenning2002planning}.
This study aims to examine the effects of using Planning Poker within a project on the quality of code produced.

\section{Introduction}
Within agile development, a lot of factors come in to play when managing a project. One major factor is the use of user stories for planning the project.
Within agile development it has become more and more important to have accurate time estimates.
There has been some studies on the accuracy of estimates, where planning poker has been found to
possibly increase the accuracy of estimates\cite{molokken2007combining}.

In Agile development, Planning Poker isn't rated as one of the most important aspects\cite{Williams:2012:ATT:2133806.2133823}, and we ask ourselves why? Could developers perhaps not see the, perhaps hidden, beneficial aspects of Planning Poker, or is it simply so that developers dislike using Planning Poker?
We will therefore try to explore the possibly hidden benefits of using Planning Poker.


\section{Purpose}

This study will examine Planning Poker as a method to estimate time required for tasks within a programming project. It is to be investigated especially how the test participants experience the method, but also how the estimates compare to other methods.

\section{Research questions}
We want to examine:
\begin{itemize}
		\item Precision of estimates
		\item experienced work for participants
		\item participants appreciation of the method
		\item time spent estimating
\end{itemize}
Of particular interest is examining if and how the accuracy of estimates affect participants appreciation of the method.

\section{Limitations}
The study will only involve two different methods of time estimation.
The study only involves one group of programmers.

\section{Background and related works}
In order to explore the relationship between the use of planning poker and code quality, we first need to define both concepts.

\subsection{Planning Poker}
Planning Poker was first introduced as a time estimation technique by James Grenning in [year] \cite{grenning2002planning}.
Grenning suggests that using less precise estimates and actively involve all programmers would
decrease time spent on estimation, and give more accurate estimates. The concept has since been
explored in several other projects and has been found to contribute to an increased accuracy of
estimates\cite{Mahni20122086,1667560}.

Planning poker has been suggested to have other benefits apart from accurate estimations, such as increased knowledge sharing and programmer enjoyment\cite{molokken2008using}. Use of Planning Poker has also been speculated to increase the quality of code produced\cite{molokken2007combining}. 

\subsection{Code Quality}
In order to perform software quality measurement, we will need some sort of explored standard.
The ISO/IEC 25010:2011 defines a quality in use model composed of eight characteristics\cite{iso250102011},
which we will use to analyse the quality of our code:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.25em}
\item functional suitability
\item reliability
\item performance efficiency
\item usability
\item security
\item compatibility
\item maintainability
\item portability
\end{itemize}

Agile teams often find the use of automated tools for code quality assurance important\cite{Williams:2012:ATT:2133806.2133823}, and we will try to evaluate how we can incorporate that into our testing\cite{ala2005survey}.

\section{Method}

We will try to make use of stuff like code reviews to measure the Code Quality.

\section{Conclusion}

Our conclusion is that...
