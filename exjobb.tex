\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Planning poker is a technique for estimating the time required for tasks
within a programming project, which tries to eliminate certain biases of
the participants in order to achieve greater accuracy of the estimates\cite{grenning2002planning}.
This study aims to examine the effecs of using Planning Poker within a project on the quality of code produced.
This study aims to examine the participants perception of two different
methods for time estimation, and compare them to each other.

\section{Introduction}
Within agile development it has become more and more important to have accurate time estimates. There has been some studies on the accuracy of estimates, where planning poker has been found to possibly increase the accuracy of estimates\cite{molokken2007combining}.
But accuracy is not the only measurement by which an estimation technique can be valued. Other factors, such as group "togetherness" can affect "something".\cite{wellington2005examining}, That's why we want to examine what other factors that affect participants experience of Planning Poker.


\section{Purpose}

This study will examine Planning Poker as a method to estimate time required for tasks within a programming project. It is to be investigated especcialy how the test participants experience the method, but also how the estimates compare to other methods.

\section{Research questions}
We want to examine:
\begin{itemize}
		\item Precision of estimates
		\item experienced work for participants
		\item participants appreciation of the method
		\item time spent estimating
\end{itemize}
Of particular interest is examining if and how the accuracy of estimates affect participants appreciation of the method.

\section{Limitations}
The study will only involve two different methods of time estimation.
The study only involves one group of programmers.

\section{Background and related works}
There are…

\subsection{Planning Poker}
Planning Poker was first introduced as a time estimation technique by James Grenning in year.\cite{grenning2002planning}

\subsection{Code Quality}
In order to perform software quality measurement, we will need some sort of explored standard. The ISO/IEC 25010:2011 defines a quality in use model composed of five characteristics,\cite{iso250102011} which we will use to analyse the quality of our code.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this

% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
